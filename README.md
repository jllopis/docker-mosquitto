Mosquitto MQTT Broker on Docker Image.

# Version

**mosquitto** v1.6.9

This version implement MQTT over WebSocket. You can use an MQTT JavaScript library to connect, like Paho: https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript

It has the auth plugin `https://github.com/jpmens/mosquitto-auth-plug` included. It uses (and is compiled with) support for `Redis`, `PostgreSQL`, `http` and `JWT` backends. The additional config for this plugin (sample `auth-plugin.conf` included) can be bind mounted in the extended configuration directory: `/etc/mosquitto.d`. Any file with a `.conf` extension will be loaded by `mosquitto` on startup.

For details on the auth plugin configuration, refer to the author repository. A little quick&dirty example its included at the end.

The docker images builds with _Official Alpine Linux edge_.

# Build

Use the provide _Makefile_ to build the image.

Alternatively you can start it by means of [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose): `docker-compose up`. This is useful when testing. It start up _redis_ and link it to _mosquitto_ so you can test the _auth-plugin_ easily.

## Build the Mosquitto docker image

    $ sudo make

You can specify your repository and tag by

    $ sudo make REPOSITORY=my_own_repo/mqtt TAG=v1.6.9

Default for **REPOSITORY** is **jllopis/mosquitto** (should change this) and for **TAG** is **mosquitto version (1.5 now)**.

Actually the command executed by make is

    docker build --no-cache -t jllopis/mosquitto:v1.6.9 .

# Persistence and Configuration

If you want to use persistence for the container or just use a custom config file you must use **VOLUMES** from your host or better, data only containers.

The container has three directories that you can use:

- **/etc/mosquitto** to store _mosquitto_ configuration files

- **/etc/mosquitto.d** to store additional configuration files that will be loaded after _/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf_

- **/var/lib/mosquitto** to persist the database

The logger outputs to **stderr** by default.
)
See the following examples for some guidance:

## Mapping host directories

    $ sudo docker run -ti \
      -v /tmp/mosquitto/etc/mosquitto:/etc/mosquitto \
      -v /tmp/mosquitto/etc/mosquitto.d:/etc/mosquitto.d \
      -v /tmp/mosquitto/var/lib/mosquitto:/var/lib/mosquitto \
      -v /tmp/mosquitto/auth-plug.conf:/etc/mosquitto.d/auth-plugin.conf \
      --name mqtt \
      -p 1883:1883 \
      -p 9883:9883 \
      jllopis/mosquitto:v1.6.9

## Data Only Containers

You must create a container to hold the directories first:

    $ sudo docker run -d -v /etc/mosquitto -v /etc/mosquitto.d -v /var/lib/mosquitto --name mqtt_data busybox /bin/true

and then just use **VOLUMES_FROM** in your container:

    $ sudo docker run -ti \
      --volumes-from mqtt_data \
      --name mqtt \
      -p 1883:1883 \
      -p 9883:9883 \
      jllopis/mosquitto:v1.6.9

The image will save its auth data (if configured) to _redis_. You can start and link a _redis_ container or use an existing _redis_ instance (remember to configure the plugin).

The included `docker-compose.yml` file is a good example of how to do it.

# Example of authenticated access

By default, there is an `admin` superuser added to `auth-plugin.conf`. We will use it as an example.

## 1. Start a Redis instance

    $ sudo docker run -d \
      --name redis_1 \
      -p 6379 \
      -v ${PWD}/tmp/redis-data:/data \
      redis:3

## 2. Start mosquitto with the linked redis

    $ sudo docker run -d \
      -v ${PWD}/mosquitto/etc/mosquitto:/etc/mosquitto \
      -v ${PWD}/mosquitto/etc/mosquitto.d:/etc/mosquitto.d \
      -v ${PWD}/mosquitto/var/lib/mosquitto:/var/lib/mosquitto \
      -v ${PWD}/mosquitto/auth-plug.conf:/etc/mosquitto.d/auth-plugin.conf \
      --name mqtt \
      -p 1883:1883 \
      -p 9883:9883 \
      --link redis:mosquitto.redis.link \
      jllopis/mosquitto:v1.6.9

## 3. Add a password for the admin user

(or whatever user u have configured...)

Example username: `admin` ***(Note: the username does not influence the password hash)***

Example password: `secretpass`


    $ docker run -ti --rm jllopis/mosquitto:v1.6.9 np -p secretpass
    PBKDF2$sha256$901$5nH8dWZV5NXTI63/$0n3XrdhMxe7PedKZUcPKMd0WHka4408V

Example username: `admin`

Example password hash: `PBKDF2$sha256$901$5nH8dWZV5NXTI63/$0n3XrdhMxe7PedKZUcPKMd0WHka4408V` ***(Note: the hash is generated using the previous command)***

    $ docker run -it --link redis_1:redis --rm redis sh -c 'exec redis-cli -h "$REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR" -p "$REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT"'
    172.17.0.64:6379> SET admin PBKDF2$sha256$901$5nH8dWZV5NXTI63/$0n3XrdhMxe7PedKZUcPKMd0WHka4408V
    OK
    172.17.0.64:6379> QUIT


## 4. Subscribe to a test channel

    $ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test

## 5. Publish to test channel

    $ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test -m "sample pub"

And... nothing happens becouse our `anonymous` user have no permission on that channel. Check the _mosquitto_ logs:

    mosquitto_1 | 1437183848: New connection from 192.168.59.3 on port 1883.

    mosquitto_1 | 1437183848: Received DISCONNECT from mosqpub/14736-MacBook-P

Cool!! Lets try again:

    $ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test -m "sample pub" -u admin -P secretpass

see the logs:

    mosquitto_1 | 1437183987: New connection from 192.168.59.3 on port 1883.

    mosquitto_1 | 1437183987: Received DISCONNECT from mosqpub/14767-MacBook-P

Much better... But, did you get any output in the `mosquitto_sub`? None. Try this and replay:

    $ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test -u admin -P secretpass

And now everything *should* work! ;)
